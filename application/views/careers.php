<p>Building scalable solutions for world-class problems</p>
<p>At Shopper's Stop, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate, build and break things for the benefit of our customers. That intense focus on customers is why we are one of the world's most beloved brands - it's part of our company DNA.</p>

<p>Our challenges are big - impacting millions of customers, sellers and developers, and countless products; and our path is not always easy. Doing the right thing rarely is. So we're selective about who joins us on this journey. There's a certain kind of person who takes on the challenges of software development at Shopper's Stop - someone excited by the idea of owning; people who like to build new platforms, features and services from scratch, developers who can manage the ambiguity and pace of a company whose ship cycles are measured in weeks, not years.</p>

<p>Shopper's Stop is a place where builders build.</p>
