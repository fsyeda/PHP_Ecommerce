<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><kbd>+ Why should I become a registered user?</kbd></p>
<p>You will not be required to re-enter your shipping or billing addresses every time you order online. Whenever you place an order, it will be delivered to the registered address on file, unless you direct us otherwise.
You can browse, shop and, if necessary, complete your order at a later time. We'll keep track of the items you've already put in your shopping bag so that when you come back later, you will not have to re-select the items again. Note that placing items to your shopping bag for purchase at a later time does not guarantee item availability.</p>
